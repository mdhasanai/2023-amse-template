## Project Overview

- Objective: Understand the distribution and usage patterns of EV charging stations in Germany.
- Questions:
  - What are the usage patterns of electric vehicle charging stations in Germany?
  - How does the number of charging points and power capacity vary across different types of charging stations?
  - Which areas in Germany have the highest and lowest concentration of charging stations?
  - Are certain types of charging stations more prevalent in specific regions or urban areas?

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas plotly 'SQLAlchemy==1.4.46' nbformat pysqlite seaborn matplotlib
```

## Data Sources

1. **Electric Charging Station**:

## Data Loading

Code provided in the project imports necessary libraries, connects to an SQLite database, and loads datasets into Pandas dataframes. For comprehensive data processing, both datasets were merged, cleaned, and preprocessed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The project contains detailed analysis on:

1. Distribution of the number of charging points.
2. Usage patterns based on the type of charging device.
3. Variation in the number of charging points and power capacity across different types of charging stations.
4. Regions in Germany with the highest and lowest concentration of charging stations.
5. Types of charging stations prevalent in certain regions or urban areas.

## Limitations and Conclusion

- **Limitations**:
  - Data quality and biases might affect the analysis.
  - Potential underestimation due to only considering registered charging stations.
  - Lack of population density data.
  - No future projections or predictions provided.

- **Conclusion**: 
  - The analysis highlights the current state of the EV charging landscape in Germany.
  - Emphasizes the need for expanding the charging network in areas with limited coverage.
  - Regular monitoring and updates are crucial for keeping up with the evolving EV landscape.
