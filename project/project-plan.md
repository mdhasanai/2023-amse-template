# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This data science project involves analyzing the availability and usage of electric vehicle charging stations in Germany. The analysis will focus on identifying usages patterns. The project will use statistical and machine-learning approaches to get meaningful insights from the data.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
Analyzing the air quality data has several benefits, such as identifying usages patterns and areas with needs for charging station. Ultimately, these insights can lead to improvements in environmental sustainability etc.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
